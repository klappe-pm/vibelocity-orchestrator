- Understand what the Multi-Agent System does and why it matters
- Complete your first successful task using intelligent model selection
- Know how to activate agents and leverage sub-agents
- Feel confident navigating the system for your own projects

## What is the Multi-Agent System?

The Power Prompts Multi-Agent System is a framework that orchestrates specialized AI agents to accomplish complex software development tasks. Think of it as having a team of expert consultants, each specializing in different domains.

### Key Concepts

**Agents**: Specialized AI personalities with clear roles and scope boundaries
- **Architecture Discovery Agent**: Maps project structure and dependencies
- **Model Orchestrator Tool Agent**: Improves Python code in Model Orchestrator
- **Framework Development Agent**: Creates agent definitions and workflows
- **Documentation Knowledge Agent**: Writes user-facing documentation

**Sub-Agents**: Specialized helpers spawned by primary agents for focused work
- Example: Documentation Agent spawns Technical Writer, User Guide Specialist, and API Documentation Writer

**Model Orchestrator**: Intelligent system that selects optimal AI models based on task requirements
- Balances quality, cost, and speed
- Supports 52 models across 6 providers
- Prefers local models (>70% usage) to minimize costs

### Why Use This System?

**Traditional Approach**:
- Manually select AI model for each task
- Hope the model understands the context
- Risk scope creep and inconsistent results
- Pay premium costs for all tasks

**Multi-Agent Approach**:
- Agents auto-activate based on task type
- Clear scope boundaries ensure focused work
- Sub-agents handle specialized tasks in parallel
- Intelligent model selection optimizes cost (>70% local, <$0.06/task average)

---
## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
### Required
- **Claude Code CLI** installed and working
- **Git** for version control
- **Python 3.8+** for Model Orchestrator
- **Text editor** for viewing files

### Optional (Recommended)
- **Ollama** for local models (free, privacy-preserving)
- **Cloud API Keys** for premium models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google)

### Quick Environment Check

```bash
# Verify Python
python3 --version  # Should be 3.8+

# Verify Git
git --version

# Check if Ollama installed (optional)
which ollama || echo "Ollama not installed (optional)"

# Check API keys (optional)
echo ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:0:10} || echo "No Anthropic key"
echo ${OPENAI_API_KEY:0:10} || echo "No OpenAI key"
```

**Don't worry if you don't have everything yet!** You can complete the first tutorial with just Python and Git.

## Your First Success: 10-Minute Quick Win

Let's get you a successful result in the next 10 minutes.

### Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory (30 seconds)

```bash
cd /Users/kevinlappe/Obsidian/Power\ Prompts
pwd  # Verify you're in the right place
```

**Expected Output**: `/Users/kevinlappe/Obsidian/Power Prompts`

### Step 2: Verify Project Structure (30 seconds)

```bash
# Check key directories exist
ls -d gitignore/Claude\ Agents/  # Agent definitions
ls -d Model\ Orchestrator/       # Orchestrator code
ls CLAUDE.md                     # Project configuration
```

**Expected Output**: All paths should exist without errors.

### Step 3: Review Available Agents (1 minute)

```bash
# List all agent definitions
ls gitignore/Claude\ Agents/*.md | head -5

# Quick peek at one agent
head -30 gitignore/Claude\ Agents/Architecture-Discovery-Agent.md
```

**What to Notice**:
- YAML frontmatter with agent metadata
- Clear role and responsibilities
- Sub-agent definitions
- Scope contract (permitted/forbidden operations)

### Step 4: Understanding Agent Activation (2 minutes)

Agents activate automatically based on your request keywords. You don't need to manually select agents - Claude Code handles this for you.

**Activation Examples**:

```
Request: "Analyze the project architecture and map dependencies"
� Activates: Architecture Discovery Agent
� Why: Keywords "analyze", "architecture", "map dependencies"

Request: "Improve the Model Orchestrator code for better performance"
� Activates: Model Orchestrator Tool Agent
� Why: Keywords "improve", "Model Orchestrator", "performance"

Request: "Create comprehensive user documentation"
� Activates: Documentation Knowledge Agent
� Why: Keywords "create", "user documentation"
```

### Step 5: Your First Agent Request (3 minutes)

Let's make a simple request to see an agent in action.

**Request to Claude Code**:
```
"Show me the structure of the gitignore/Claude Agents/ directory
and summarize what agents are available."
```

**What Happens Behind the Scenes**:
1. Claude Code analyzes your request
2. Detects keywords: "structure", "agents", "summarize"
3. Activates Architecture Discovery Agent (appropriate for structure analysis)
4. Agent reads directory and creates summary
5. You receive organized results within scope boundaries

**Expected Result**: A summary of available agents organized by tier and role.

### Step 6: Understanding the Output (2 minutes)

Your agent response should include:
- **Agent Identification**: Which agent handled the request
- **Scope Compliance**: Stayed within permitted operations
- **Clear Results**: Structured information addressing your request
- **No Scope Violations**: Didn't attempt forbidden operations

### Step 7: Check Project Context (1 minute)

```bash
# View current project state
cat gitignore/Claude\ Context/CLAUDE.context.md | head -50
```

**What to Notice**:
- Current phase status
- Recent decisions and changes
- Open issues
- Next steps

This file is the single source of truth for project state. Agents read this to understand context before executing tasks.

### Checkpoint: First Success Achieved

**Congratulations!** You've just:
- Made your first agent request
- Seen automatic agent activation in action
- Understood the scope boundary system
- Learned where to find project context

## Hands-On Exercises

Practice makes perfect. Try these exercises to solidify your understanding.

### Exercise 1: Agent Identification

For each request, identify which agent would activate:

1. "Review the Python code in Model Orchestrator for potential bugs"
2. "Create a new Performance Optimization Agent definition"
3. "Write API documentation for the model selection functions"
4. "Map all file dependencies in the project"

<details>
<summary>Click to see answers</summary>

1. Model Orchestrator Tool Agent (keywords: "review", "Python code", "Model Orchestrator")
2. Framework Development Agent (keywords: "create", "Agent definition")
3. Documentation Knowledge Agent (keywords: "write", "API documentation")
4. Architecture Discovery Agent (keywords: "map", "dependencies")

</details>

### Exercise 2: Scope Boundaries

Review an agent definition and answer:
1. What directories can this agent access?
2. What operations are forbidden?
3. What file types can it create?

```bash
# Open any agent definition
cat gitignore/Claude\ Agents/Documentation-Knowledge-Agent.md | grep -A 20 "Scope Contract"
```

### Exercise 3: Model Selection

Open the Model Orchestrator API documentation and find:
1. How many models are supported?
2. What's the default selection strategy?
3. How do you force local-only model selection?

```bash
# Search for answers
grep -n "supported models\|selection strategy\|local-only" Model\ Orchestrator/API-Documentation.md
```

## Common Questions at This Stage

### "Do I need all the local models installed?"
No. The system works with cloud models only (you just need API keys). Local models are optional for cost savings and privacy.

### "How do I know which agent is best for my task?"
You don't need to choose - Claude Code automatically selects the best agent based on your request keywords. Just ask in natural language.

### "What if an agent tries to do something outside its scope?"
Agents have built-in scope boundaries. If a task is outside scope, the agent will refuse or hand off to another agent.

### "Can I create my own agents?"
Yes! See Tutorial 3 and the Agent Creation Tutorial for step-by-step instructions.

### "How much does this cost?"
With >70% local model usage, average cost is <$0.06 per task. You can force local-only mode for zero cost (requires Ollama setup).
